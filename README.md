# Wallset

Short terminal command to download random picture and set it as the wallpaper. Written in Rust.

## Installation

Ensure you have rust and cargo tools installed. Checkout the repository on your local computer, and open a new terminal in the directory. Then do:

``` bash
cargo build
cp target/debug/wallset ~/.local/bin
```

Once you refresh your workspace (open a new command line!), you should be able to use the command by typing `wallset`.

## Usage

Use this tool by invoking the command `wallset <...keywords>`, where keywords are a list of search terms to further specify what background you will get.
